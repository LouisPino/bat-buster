# Bat Hunter
They have wings, you have weapons



The code for a working game that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on GitHub Pages (covered next week).

A README.md file with these sections:

☐ <Your game's title>: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.





## Gameplay Screenshot(s): 
#### Images of your actual game

Note: if you edit your README.md on the github website editor, you can copy and paste image files directly to your markdown.

## Future Features

Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

☐ Frequent commits (at least 1 every day) dating back to the very beginning of the project. Never delete you repo to "start over".

Commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style game board" instead of "Styled game board".

Be sure to create the repo on your personal GitHub account and ensure that it is "public".
