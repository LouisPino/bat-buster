# Bat Buster
### They have wings, you have a bazooka


Bat Buster is a simple arcade style game. You are the town sheriff, tasked with protecting your town from a swarm of bats. Using your trusty revolver, shotgun, and state-issued granade launcher, shoot the bats down and reclaim your town! 

Bat Buster also features a defense mode, where shooting is disabled and movement mechanics are brought to the forefront.

### Getting Started: 
#### [Click here to open the game in your browser](https://louispino.github.io/bat-buster/)

#### Attack Mode:
Your goal is to eliminate as many bats as you can before losing all three lives. Try out different weapons to see which best fits your play style, and collect power ups to temporarily boost your stats.

Use WASD or ↑ ↓ → ← to move your character, avoiding bats and collecting power-ups. Use the mouse to aim, and right click or space bar to shoot. Use the number keys to switch between weapons, which each posess a different attack power and reload speed.

#### Defense Mode:
Oh no, the bats took your weapons! 

Your goal is to survive as long as possible as the enemies keep swarming. Be sure to collect your invincibilty power ups, that's the only way you can get rid of the bats once they've entered the arena!

Use both WASD and ↑ ↓ → ← to run away from the bats. The player must alternate between the two controls, just like running with both legs.
