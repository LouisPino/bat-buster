# Bat Buster
### They have wings, you have a bazooka


Bat Buster is a simple arcade style game. You are the town sheriff, tasked with protecting your town from a swarm of bats. Using your trusty revolver, shotgun, and state-issued granade launcher, shoot the bats down and reclaim your town! 

Bat Buster also features a defense mode, where shooting is disabled and movement mechanics are brought to the forefront.
