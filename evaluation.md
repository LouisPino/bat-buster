# Pino's Project 1 Evaluation


## Functionality ( 4 / 4 )
Render a game in the browser; includes separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files
No obvious bugs, broken functionality, or irregular UI behavior
Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML 
Project is deployed online using GitHub Pages. 

## Code Quality ( 3 / 3 )
Have properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript with consistent line break count between functions, variables, and comments in your code. 
Code syntax is consistent, i.e. function syntax is the same across the app; no remaining unused and/or commented out code is found in your application's main files

## Version Control ( 3 / 3 )
A public repository was created on github.com
Your repo includes (at least) 7 commits across the week of development (approximately one per day)
Commit messages are clear and describe the changes made to your project (file reference, feature descriptions, and completion status).

# Total ( 19 / 20 )
## Glows
- I think I did well with time management. I started Friday night and tried to frontload the work as much as possible. This gave me a lot of time to fine tune all of the problems that didn't completely break the game, and also allowed me to spend most of the week on stretch goals. I think the key to this was accepting that I will not come up with the answer if I've already tried to for ~20 minutes. Walking away from problems like this is something I usually have trouble doing and end up wasting a lot of time. 
<br>
- I have a tendency to leave features as they are once they just barely cross the threshold of passable. A lot of features (mostly in regards to placement/motion of things) were really buggy to the point where they were obviously glitching out, but didn't ruin the game. I eventually ironed out all of these issues once the game reached an acceptable MVP, where in the past on projects like this I would usually just be too lazy to find a solution.

## Grows 
- My JS planning was basically nonexistent. I tried to stay very organized while writing all the code, but still ran into a lot of necessary refactoring because I just started bashing at the keyboard rather than thinking first. The need for immediate small successes drove this pattern, so on the next project I need to take more time at the very beginning to plan ahead better. This idea of planning needs to be integrated into my whole process so that even when I decide to add a new feature it gets implemented in a clean and thoughtful manner. I think I got very lucky with how things played out and it could have been a lot more stressful if I happened to start out with different data structures or keep track of elements another way.

## Shoutouts
- Shoutout Josh for the MVC lecture!!!! I absolutely would not have intuitively created this game that way, and it would have gotten way too big way too fast if I hadn't. I can't imagine trying to deal with all the bugs I had to deal with if everything wasn't laid out like that.
- Also just general appreciation for Rose and Brian, it has been great working with you both and I appreciate the positive attitude you all bring to this class!!!
